## Glossary of Threading Terms

### Basic Terms
* **Multithreading:** The concurrent execution of multiple parts of a program within a single process.
* **Thread:** The smallest unit of processing that can be scheduled for execution.
* **threading module:** A Python module providing tools for creating and managing threads.

### Intermediate Terms
* **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):** A mechanism in Python that prevents multiple threads from executing Python bytecode at the same time.
* **Thread synchronization:** Coordinating the actions of multiple threads to prevent race conditions and ensure data consistency.
* **Lock:** A synchronization primitive that allows only one thread to access a shared resource at a time.
* **Semaphore:** A synchronization primitive that controls access to a shared resource by limiting the number of simultaneous users.
* **Event:** A synchronization mechanism that allows one or more threads to wait for a specific condition to occur.
* **join():** A method used to wait for a thread to finish execution before proceeding.
* **I/O bound:** A task that spends most of its time waiting for input or output operations to complete.

## Glossary of Advanced Threading Terms

### Race Conditions
* **Race condition:** When multiple threads access shared data concurrently, and the outcome depends on the unpredictable order of execution.

### Deadlocks
* **Deadlock:** A situation where two or more threads are blocked indefinitely, each waiting for the other to release a resource.
* **Mutual exclusion:** Only one thread can access a shared resource at a time.
* **Hold and wait:** A thread holds at least one resource and is waiting for another.
* **No preemption:** Resources cannot be forcibly taken from a thread.
* **Circular wait:** A chain of dependencies where each thread is waiting for a resource held by the next thread in the chain.

### Thread Pools
* **Thread pool:** A group of pre-created threads that are reused to execute tasks, improving performance and resource utilization.
* **concurrent.futures:** A Python module providing tools for asynchronous programming, including thread pools.

## Advanced Python Multithreading: MCQs

### Race Conditions

#### Question 1:
**What is a race condition?**
* a) When two or more threads access a shared resource simultaneously, and the outcome depends on the unpredictable order of execution.
* b) A deadlock situation where two or more threads are blocked indefinitely.
* c) A condition where a thread is starved of CPU time.
* d) An error in thread synchronization.

**Answer:** a) When two or more threads access a shared resource simultaneously, and the outcome depends on the unpredictable order of execution.
* **Explanation:** Race conditions occur due to the non-deterministic nature of thread scheduling.

### Deadlocks
#### Question 2:
**Which of the following conditions is NOT necessary for a deadlock to occur?**
* a) Mutual exclusion
* b) Hold and wait
* c) No preemption
* d) Resource sharing

**Answer:** d) Resource sharing
* **Explanation:** Deadlocks occur when resources are *not* shared but held exclusively by threads.

#### Question 3:
**How can deadlocks be prevented?**
* a) By using locks for all shared resources.
* b) By ensuring that all threads have access to all resources.
* c) By imposing a total ordering on resource acquisition.
* d) By using a higher priority for one of the threads.

**Answer:** c) By imposing a total ordering on resource acquisition.
* **Explanation:** This prevents circular wait conditions, which are a common cause of deadlocks.

### Thread Pools
#### Question 4:
**What is the primary advantage of using a thread pool?**
* a) Improved performance by reusing threads.
* b) Easier thread management.
* c) Reduced memory consumption.
* d) All of the above.

**Answer:** d) All of the above.
* **Explanation:** Thread pools optimize thread creation and management, leading to performance gains and reduced resource usage.

#### Question 5:
**Which Python module provides tools for creating and managing thread pools?**
* a) `threading`
* b) `concurrent.futures`
* c) `multiprocessing`
* d) `asyncio`

**Answer:** b) `concurrent.futures`
* **Explanation:** The `concurrent.futures` module offers a higher-level interface for asynchronous programming, including thread pools.

## Multithreading

```python
import threading

def worker():
    print("Worker thread started")
    # Do some work
    print("Worker thread finished")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    thread = threading.Thread(target=worker)
    thread.start()
    thread.join()
```

This code creates a new thread and starts its execution. The main thread waits for the worker thread to finish using `join()`.

## Semaphore

```python
import threading
import time

semaphore = threading.Semaphore(2)  # Allow only 2 concurrent accesses

def worker(num):
    semaphore.acquire()
    print(f"Worker {num} started")
    time.sleep(2)
    print(f"Worker {num} finished")
    semaphore.release()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    threads = []
    for i in range(5):
        thread = threading.Thread(target=worker, args=(i,))
        threads.append(thread)
        thread.start()

    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()
```

This code uses a semaphore to limit the number of concurrent workers to 2.

## Thread Synchronization

```python
import threading

counter = 0
lock = threading.Lock()

def increment():
    global counter
    with lock:
        counter += 1

def decrement():
    global counter
    with lock:
        counter -= 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    threads = []
    for _ in range(10):
        t = threading.Thread(target=increment)
        threads.append(t)
        t.start()

    for _ in range(10):
        t = threading.Thread(target=decrement)
        threads.append(t)
        t.start()

    for t in threads:
        t.join()

    print(counter)
```

This code demonstrates thread synchronization using a lock to protect the shared counter variable.

## Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

While the GIL is a Python implementation detail, it's important to understand its implications:

* **Single thread execution:** Only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time.
* **I/O bound tasks:** Multithreading can be beneficial for I/O bound tasks as the GIL is released during I/O operations.
* **CPU bound tasks:** Multithreading is less effective for CPU bound tasks due to the GIL.

To overcome the limitations of the GIL for CPU-bound tasks, consider using the `multiprocessing` module.

**Note:** The provided code examples demonstrate basic concepts. Real-world applications often require more complex synchronization mechanisms and careful consideration of thread safety.

## Single Threading, Multithreading, Parallelism, and Scheduling - Simplified

### Single Threading
* **One job at a time.** Like waiting in a single line.

### Multithreading
* **Many jobs at once.** Like having multiple people working on different tasks in a single room.

### Parallelism
* **Many jobs at the same time.** Like having multiple people working on different tasks in different rooms.

### Scheduling
* **Deciding who does what and when.** Like assigning tasks to people in a busy office.

**Example: A restaurant**
* **Single thread:** One cook making orders one by one.
* **Multithreading:** Multiple cooks working on different orders at the same time.
* **Parallelism:** Multiple cooks working on different orders in different kitchens.
* **Scheduling:** Deciding which cook makes which order and when.
